# Amazone Clone

Amazone Clone is a front-end demonstration of an Amazon-like e-commerce interface created primarily with HTML and CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript for interactivity. This project reproduces common UI patterns — product listing, product cards, responsive layout, and a mock cart/checkout flow — and is intended as a visual demo or starting point for further development.

## Features

- Responsive product listing and grid layout
- Product card UI with images, title, price, and action buttons
- Simple cart UI and interactive behaviors (built with minimal JS)
- Mobile-first responsive styling and accessible markup
- Easily extendable to add a backend, database, or payment provider

## Tech overview

- HTML — structure and semantic content (≈74% of repo)
- CSS — styling and responsive layout (≈25% of repo)
- JavaScript — small interactions and UI behavior (≈1% of repo)

## Demo / Preview

Add screenshots or a link to a live demo here (GitHub Pages or other host) to showcase the UI.
